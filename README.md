Authors: Johannes Rainer and Michael Witting.

This repository contains some utility functions to integrate `xcms`-based data
  processing into the GNPS [Feature-Based Molecular Networking](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking/) workflow (FBMN). See [this page](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/featurebasedmolecularnetworking-with-xcms3) for details on xcms integration into FBMN, and the following [GitHub repo](https://github.com/DorresteinLaboratory/XCMS3_FeatureBasedMN) for example scripts as Jupyter notebook and RCommander script.
